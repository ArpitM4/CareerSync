## Contributing   
## Please follow these steps to contribute:  
## Fork the repository   
## Create a new branch: 
```git checkout -b yourname``` 

## To pull the latest code from the main branch into a different branch locally, follow these steps: 

## 1. Switch to Your Current Branch
Make sure you're on the branch where you want to pull the main branch code:

```git checkout your-branch-name``` 

## 2. Fetch the Latest Changes 
### Fetch the latest updates from the remote repository: 

```git fetch origin``` 

### 3. Pull the main Branch Code 
### Now, pull the latest main branch code into your current branch: 

```git pull origin main``` 

### This merges the changes from the main branch into your current branch. You might need to resolve any merge conflicts if there are differences between the branches. 

### 4. Resolve Conflicts (If Any) 

### If there are merge conflicts, Git will inform you. Open the conflicting files, resolve the issues, and then stage the resolved files using: 

```git add file-name``` 
### Once all conflicts are resolved, commit the merge: 

### git commit 
Now, your current branch contains the latest code from the main branch! 

### Edit files 
#### Add changes to push into github using command: 
```git add .``` 

## Make and commit your changes:    
```git commit -m 'Add some feature'``` 

## Push to the branch: 
```git push origin yourname```   
## Open a pull request
